- [x] 4. Add comprehensive JavaDoc documentation to all public methods
- [x] 5. Remove code duplication in service classes
- [ ] 6. Implement consistent logging strategy across all classes
- [ ] 7. Add equals() and hashCode() methods to entity classes
- [ ] 8. Use constructor injection consistently across all classes
- [ ] 9. Add validation annotations to entity classes
- [ ] 10. Refactor long methods to improve readability and maintainability
